# App Elements

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40commercelayer%2Fapp-elements)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercelayer/app-elements)

The Commerce Layer admin dashboard has a Hub section for back-office applications built on top of our APIs that facilitates the use of some of the platform's main features.

<img width="700" alt="You can access the Hub section from the dashboard sidebar menu" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1681269/268583888-265c7b96-d6d1-451c-9353-a59a4de6edb6.png">

`App Elements` is the React component library for building these Hub applications. This library contains different components, helpers, and hooks, from simple and small bits like `Button` or `Card` to complex components like `OrderSummary`.
