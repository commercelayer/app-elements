# Toast

This consists of two main parts: the `<ToastContainer>` component and the `toast` method.

The `<ToastContainer>` is responsible for rendering toast notifications whenever the `toast` method is invoked.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
import { ToastContainer, toast } from '@commercelayer/react-components'

export default function App() {
  const notify = () => toast('Hi there!');

  return (
    <div>
      <ToastContainer />
      <button onClick={notify}>Greet</button>
    </div>
  );
}
`}
/>

<span type="info">
Remember to render the `ToastContainer` once in your application tree. If you can't figure out where to put it, rendering it in the application root would be the best bet.
</span>
