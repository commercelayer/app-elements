`App Elements` is a React components library used to build Commerce Layer dashboard HUB apps.
This library contains different types of components, helpers and hooks, from simple and small bits like `Button` or `Card` to complex components like `InputResourceGroup`.

## Installation and requirements

This library is served as npm package and need to be installed as dependency inside your project.

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  code={`
pnpm add @commercelayer/app-elements
`}
/>

The package does not include some required dependencies listed as `peerDependencies`. If you use `pnpm`, you will find useful to have `auto-install-peers=true` in you `.npmrc` file.
Otherwise you need to also install the following packages:

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  code={`
pnpm add @commercelayer/sdk query-string react-hook-form wouter
`}
/>

<blockquote title="Important notice" type="info">
  At this time we only support ViteJS as main bundler (even if other bundlers might be used without any issue), and all
  dashboard apps require `pnpm` as package manager. Also, all Commerce Layer dashboard apps use
  [wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) as react routing, this create a strong relationship with it also inside
  this package.
</blockquote>

## Local development

To work with this repo you can preview components directly in storybook, launching a development server.

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  code={`
pnpm install
pnpm dev
`}
/>

You can link this package in other applications using `pnpm`:

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  code={`
pnpm build:elements --watch

cd ~/projects/app-elements/packages/app-elements
pnpm link --global

cd ~/projects/my-app/packages/app
pnpm link --global @commercelayer/app-elements
`} />
