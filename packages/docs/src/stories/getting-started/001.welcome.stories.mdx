`App Elements` is a React components library used to build Commerce Layer dashboard HUB apps. 
This library contains different types of components, helpers and hooks, from simple and small bits like `Button` o `Card` to complex components like `OrderSummary`.

# Installation and requirements
This library is served as npm package and need to be installed as dependency inside your project or forked app.

```
pnpm add @commercelayer/app-elements
```

The package does not include some required dependencies listed as `peerDependencies`. If you use `pnpm`, you will find useful to have `auto-install-peers=true` in you `.npmrc` file.
Otherwise you need to also install the following packages

```
pnpm add @commercelayer/sdk query-string react-hook-form wouter
```

Notes:
At this time we only support ViteJS as main bundler, even if other bundlers might be used without any issue and all dashboard apps require `pnpm` as package manager.
Also, all Commerce Layer dashboard apps use [wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) as react router, this create a strong relationship with it also inside this package.


## Local development

To work with this repo you can preview components directly in storybook, launching a development server.

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

You can link this package in other applications using `pnpm`:
```
pnpm build:elements --watch

cd ~/projects/app-elements/packages/app-elements
pnpm link --global

cd ~/projects/my-app/packages/app
pnpm link --global @commercelayer/app-elements
```
