# Custom apps

All applications showcased on the Dashboard hub provide extensive customization options. You can enhance their functionality by adding new features, extending existing ones, and integrating with third-party APIs, among other possibilities.

After you made your changes and thoroughly tested your custom app, you can seamlessly integrate it into the Dashboard, making it accessible to your entire team. To ensure visibility for every member of your organization, the administrator can enable each custom application individually on the _Team_ section.

## How to customize an application

Here is a step-by-step guide to kickstart the customization of one of the available applications:

1. Choose the app you want to customize and fork the related repository (e.g. [app-orders](https://github.com/commercelayer/app-orders)) to your GitHub account.
1. Use the `organizationSlug` within the `TokenProvider` context, as explained in detail [here](/docs/getting-started-token-provider--docs#how-to-configure-the-token-provider-with-a-custom-app).
1. Customize the app to meet your specific requirements.
1. Thoroughly test the application on your local environment.
1. Proceed to host and deploy your customized app. This can be done swiftly using platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
1. As a final step, include the name and deployment URL in the Dashboard.

Watch the instructional video below to learn more: it goes through the whole process of hosting your custom app on Vercel and making it available on the hub.

## Roles and permissions

Each application is equipped with a different set of permissions. You can examine these permissions using the `useTokenProvider` hook, as detailed [here](/docs/getting-started-token-provider--docs#how-to-read-exposed-information-from-react-context). To review the set of permissions specific to the application you plan to customize, please refer to the [applications](/docs/getting-started-applications--docs) section.

  In the near future, we will introduce a new type of customizable application
  that will come with comprehensive permissions, granting access to all the
  necessary Commerce Layer APIs.

## Cross-linking

<span type="warning">
  Once you've customized and added an application to the hub, cross-linking
  between applications will no longer be possible. Consequently, we recommend
  customizing not only the primary application but also any linked applications.
