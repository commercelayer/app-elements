# Custom apps

All applications showcased on the Dashboard provide extensive customization options. You can enhance their functionality by adding new features, extending existing ones, and integrating with third-party APIs, among other possibilities.

After you made your changes and thoroughly tested your custom app, you can seamlessly integrate it into the Dashboard, making it accessible to your entire team. To ensure visibility for every member of your organization, the administrator can enable each custom application individually on the _Team_ section.

## How to customize an application

We manage all the applications in the [dashboard-apps](https://github.com/commercelayer/dashboard-apps) monorepo. This allows you to run them all locally effortlessly. You can choose to customize and release a single application or all of them. It's up to you.

Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a new repository from [this template](https://github.com/new?template_owner=commercelayer&template_name=dashboard-apps) (if you want to contribute you can start from a fork instead).
1. Customize the applications to meet your specific requirements.
1. Thoroughly test the applications on your local environment.
1. Proceed to host and deploy your customized apps. This can be done swiftly using platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
1. As a final step, include the name and deployment URL in the Dashboard.

<div className='rounded' style={{ backgroundColor: '#f8f8f8', marginBottom: '24px', padding: '20px 0px 10px' }}>
  <img
    alt="The last step for a new custom app. Name and deployment URL are required."
    src="dashboard-new-custom-app.png"
    className='rounded'
    style={{ margin: '0 auto', maxWidth: '500px', width: '100%' }}
    />
</div>

<span type="warning">
  By default all applications can run on each organization.
  You can force the application to work only on one organization by setting the environment variable `PUBLIC_SELF_HOSTED_SLUG` (e.g. `PUBLIC_SELF_HOSTED_SLUG=my-org`).
</span>

## Roles and permissions

Each application is equipped with a different set of permissions. When you fork the related repository, your custom apps inherits those permission.
You can examine them using the `useTokenProvider` hook, as detailed [here](/docs/getting-started-token-provider--docs#how-to-read-exposed-information-from-react-context). To review the set of permissions specific to the application you plan to customize, please refer to the [applications](/docs/getting-started-applications--docs) section.

<span type="info" title="Coming soon">
  In the near future, we will introduce a new type of customizable application
  that will come with comprehensive permissions, granting access to all the
  necessary Commerce Layer APIs.

## Cross-linking

<span type="warning">
  Once you've customized and added an application to the Dashboard, cross-linking
  between applications will no longer be possible. Consequently, we recommend
  customizing not only the primary application but also any linked applications.
