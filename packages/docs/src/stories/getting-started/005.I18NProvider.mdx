# I18N Provider

The `<I18NProvider>` is the component that is in charge of providing the i18n context to localize all apps.

It uses the [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) library to manage translations.

This is still to be considered as work in progress, since only a partial list of apps currently support translations, but all apps already need to be wrapped with this provider or shared elements won't be localized.

<span type="warning" title="Dependencies">
The `<I18NProvider>` component requires access to the `<TokenProvider>` context, so it must be placed as its child and should wrap the entire app.
</span>

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
<TokenProvider
  kind="orders"
  appSlug="orders"
  reauthenticateOnInvalidAuth={!isDev}
  devMode={isDev}
>
  <CoreSdkProvider>
    <I18NProvider>
      <div>app content</div>
    </I18NProvider>
  </CoreSdkProvider>
</TokenProvider>
