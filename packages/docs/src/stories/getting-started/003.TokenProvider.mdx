# Token provider

The `<TokenProvider>` is the component that is in charge to handle the app authentication by reading and validating the received `accessToken`. It must be present at the top level of your application and can be configured using its props.

When this component is mounted, it does the following:

1. Checks the presence of an `accessToken` from the current URL or if it exists in `localStorage`.
1. Validates the token by checking its expiration date and if it's valid for the current `organization` and the current `app`. This is required to ensure that your app is only accessible with an authorized and specific token, generated from your Commerce Layer Dashboard.
1. If the access token is missing or invalid, it calls your Commerce Layer Dashboard to automatically generate a valid one.
1. Once a valid token is retrieved, it is used to fetch the user details and permissions. This info will be available within your app via React Context.

## Inizialization

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
<TokenProvider
  kind="orders" // application kind used to generate dashboard token
  appSlug="orders" // slug or name of current app
  domain={window.clAppConfig.domain} // it must be 'commercelayer.io'
  reauthenticateOnInvalidAuth={!isDev} // automatically redirect you to the dashboard in order to retrieve a new token. Keep it as 'false' during development mode.
  devMode={isDev} // when development mode is active, all validation will be skipped and you can use an integration token for you local development.
>
  <div>app content</div>
</TokenProvider>
`}
/>

# How to configure the token provider with a custom app

During the token validation, the component reads the organization slug from the current URL subdomain. This only works for all Commerce Layer hosted apps since they share the same URL structure.

<span type="info">
  When you are using a custom app (self-hosted), you can provide the
  `organizationSlug` prop in order to let the component know which organization
  is the owner of the current token. In this way no one else can use your
  deployed version of the app with a different token.
</span>

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
<TokenProvider organizationSlug="demo-store">
  <div>app content</div>
</TokenProvider>
`}
/>

## How to read exposed information from React Context

It's possible to import `useTokenProvider` hook and access in any part of your application to the following data:

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
const {
  canAccess,
  canUser,
  dashboardUrl,
  organization,
  settings: { mode, accessToken, appSlug, domain, organizationSlug },
  user
} = useTokenProvider()
`}
/>

### `canAccess`

This method is used to check if the current user has the permission to access a specific app by providing its slug.

### `canUser`

This method is used to check the CRUD permissions, i.e. if the current user has the permission to create, read, update, and/or destroy a specific resource. It returns `true` or `false` based on the current logged user.

<span type="info" title="Application roles">
  You can have a look at the [related
  section](/docs/getting-started-applications--docs) to check the comprehensive
  list of all the available application roles.
</span>

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
canUser('create', 'shipments');
canUser('read', 'order');
canUser('update', 'customers');

if (canUser('destroy', 'webhooks')) {
return <button>Delete webhook</button>;
}
`} />

### `dashboardUrl`

This is the URL to the dashboard. Can be `undefined`.

### `organization`

It contains the [organization object](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/organization/object). Can be `null`.

### `settings`

<Source
  language="ts"
  dark
  code={`
interface TokenProviderAuthSettings {
  accessToken: string
  appSlug: string
  domain: string
  mode: Mode
  organizationSlug: string
}
`}
/>

Here below a simple example on how to access the current mode (`test` | `live`) from the `settings` object:

<Source
  language="ts"
  dark
  code={`
const { settings } = useTokenProvider();
console.log(settings.mode);
`}
/>

### `user`

This can be `null` if you are authenticating the app with a token that does not contains a valid `User` (e.g. an [integration](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/applications#integration) token).

<Source
  language="ts"
  dark
  code={`
interface TokenProviderAuthUser {
  id: string
  email: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  displayName: string
  fullName: string
  timezone: string
}
`}
/>

Here below a simple example on how to get the current user timezone or it's full name:

<Source
  language="ts"
  dark
  code={`
const { user } = useTokenProvider();
console.log(user?.timezone);
console.log(user?.fullName);
`}
/>
