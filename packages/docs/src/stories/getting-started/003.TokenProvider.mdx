# TokenProvider

The `<TokenProvider>` is the component that is in charge to handle app authentication by reading and validating the received `accessToken`.
It must be present at the top level of your application and can be configured using its props.

When this component is mounted, it does the following:

1. Checks the presence of an `accessToken` from the current URL or if it exists in `localStorage`.
1. Validates the token by checking its expiration and if it's valid for current `organization` and current `app`. This is required to ensure that your app is only accessible with an authorized and specific token generated from your Commerce Layer Dashboard.
1. If access token is missing or invalid, it calls your Commerce Layer Dashboard to automatically generate a valid one.
1. Once a valid token is retrieved, it will be used to fetch user details and permissions. This info will be available within your app via react context.

## How to initialize it

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
<TokenProvider
  kind="orders" // application kind used to generate dashboard token
  appSlug="orders" // slug or name of current app
  domain={window.clAppConfig.domain} // it must be 'commercelayer.io'
  reauthenticateOnInvalidAuth={!isDev} // automatically redirect you to the dashboard in order to retrieve a new token. Keep it as 'false' during development mode.
  devMode={isDev} // when development mode is active, all validation will be skipped and you can use an integration token for you local development.
>
  <div>app content</div>
</TokenProvider>
`}
/>

### Props

<ArgsTable of={TokenProvider} />

## How to configure it with a custom app

During token validation, the component will read the organization slug from the current URL subdomain. 
This only works for all Commerce Layer hosted apps since they share the same URL structure.

<span type='info'>
When you are using a custom app (self-hosted), you need to provide the `organizationSlug` prop in order to let the component know which organization is the owner of the current token.
In this way no one else can use your deployed version of the app with a different token.
</span>

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
<TokenProvider organizationSlug="demo-store">
  <div>app content</div>
</TokenProvider>
`}
/>

## How to read exposed information from react context.

It's possible to import `useTokenProvider` hook and access in any part of your application to the following data:

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
const {
  canAccess,
  canUser,
  dashboardUrl,
  organization,
  settings: { mode, accessToken, appSlug, domain, organizationSlug },
  user
} = useTokenProvider()
`} />

### `canAccess`

This method is used to check if current user has permission to access a specific app by providing its slug.

### `canUser`

This method is used to check if current user has permission to `'create' | 'destroy' | 'read' | 'update'` a specific resource.

<span type="info" title="Application roles">
We prepared a dedicated page to review all the available [application roles](/docs/getting-started-application-roles--docs).
</span>

It will return `true` or `false` depending on the current logged user.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
canUser('create', 'shipments');
canUser('read', 'order');
canUser('update', 'customers');

if (canUser('destroy', 'webhooks')) {
  return <button>Delete webhook</button>;
}
`} />

### `dashboardUrl`

This is the url to the dashboard. Can be `undefined`.

### `organization`

It contains the [Organization object](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/organization/object). Can be `null`.

### `settings`

```ts
interface TokenProviderAuthSettings {
  accessToken: string
  appSlug: string
  domain: string
  mode: Mode
  organizationSlug: string
}
```

If you need to access the current mode (`test` | `live`) from the `settings` object, you can do the following:

<Source
  language="ts"
  dark
  code={`
const { settings } = useTokenProvider();
console.log(settings.mode);
`} />

### `user`

This can be `null` if you are authenticating the app with a token that does not contains a valid `User` (e.g. an integration token).

```ts
interface TokenProviderAuthUser {
  id: string
  email: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  displayName: string
  fullName: string
  timezone: string
}
```

If you need to get the current user `timezone` or it's full name, you can do the following:

<Source
  language="ts"
  dark
  code={`
const { user } = useTokenProvider();
console.log(user?.timezone);
console.log(user?.fullName);
`} />
