# TokenProvider

`<TokenProvider>` is the component that is in charge to handle app authentication by reading and validating the received `accessToken`.
It must be present at the top level of your application and can be configured using its props.

When this component is mounted, it does the following:

- Checks the presence of an `accessToken` from the current URL or if it exists in `localStorage`.
- Validates the token by checking its expiration and if it's valid for current `organization` and current `app`. This is required to ensure that your app is only accessible with an authorized and specific token generated from your Commerce Layer Dashboard.
- If access token is missing or invalid, it calls your commerce layer dashboard to automatically generate a valid one.
- Once a valid token is retrieved, it will be used to fetch user details and permissions. This info will be available within your app via react context.

## How to initialize it

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
<TokenProvider
  kind="orders" // application kind used to generate dashboard token
  appSlug="orders" // slug or name of current app
  domain={window.clAppConfig.domain} // it must be 'commercelayer.io'
  reauthenticateOnInvalidAuth={!isDev} // automatically redirect you to the dashboard in order to retrieve a new token. Keep it as 'false' during development mode.
  devMode={isDev} // when development mode is active, all validation will be skipped and you can use an integration token for you local development.
>
  <div>app content</div>
</TokenProvider>
`}
/>

## How to configure it with a forked app

## How to read exposed information from react context.

It's possible to import `useTokenProvider` hook and access in any part of your application to the following data:

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
const {
  dashboardUrl,
  canUser,
  organization,
  user,
  settings: { mode, accessToken, appSlug, domain, organizationSlug }
} = useTokenProvider()
`} />

`canUser` method is used to check if current user has permission to `'create' | 'destroy' | 'read' | 'update'` a specific resource.
It will return `true` or `false` depending on the current logged user.
Example:

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
canUser('create', 'shipments');
canUser('read', 'order');
canUser('update', 'customers');

if (canUser('destroy', 'webhooks')) {
  return <button>Delete webhook</button>;
}
`} />

- `organization` contains the `Organization` [resource object](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/organization/object)
- `user` contains the following information, if available from the authenticated token: `{id, email, firstName, lastName, displayName, fullName, timezone}`.
- `settings` contains the following information: `{ mode, accessToken, appSlug, domain, organizationSlug }`.

If you need to get the current user `timezone` or it's full name, you can do the following:

<Source
  language="ts"
  dark
  code={`
const { user } = useTokenProvider();
console.log(user?.timezone);
console.log(user?.fullName);
`} />

Please note that `user` object can be `null` if you are authenticating the app with a token that does not contains a valid `User` (example an integration token).

In the same way, if you need to access the current mode (`test` | `live`) from the `settings` object, you can do the following:

<Source
  language="ts"
  dark
  code={`
const { settings } = useTokenProvider();
console.log(settings.mode);
`} />
