The Commerce Layer admin [Dashboard](https://dashboard.commercelayer.io/sign_up) includes a _Hub_ section for back-office applications built on top of our APIs covering some of the platform's main features (such as orders or customers management, importing or exporting data, and more).

**App Elements** is the React component library used to build these hub [applications](/docs/getting-started-applications--docs). You can easily leverage it to replicate the Dashboard look and feel when [customizing your apps](/docs/getting-started-custom-apps--docs) or building any other app on top of Commerce Layer's APIs. This library features different components, helpers, and hooks, from simple and small bits like [buttons](/docs/atoms-button--docs) or [cards](/docs/atoms-card--docs) to complex components like the one you need to show a complete [order summary](/docs/resources-resourceordersummary--docs).

## Installation and requirements

This library is [open sourced](https://github.com/commercelayer/app-elements) and served as [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercelayer/app-elements). It needs to be installed as dependency inside your project:

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  code={`
pnpm add @commercelayer/app-elements
`}
/>

The package does not include some required dependencies listed as `peerDependencies`. If you use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), we suggest you set `auto-install-peers=true` in your `.npmrc` file. Otherwise, you need to also install the following packages:

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  code={`
pnpm add @commercelayer/sdk query-string react-hook-form wouter
`}
/>

<span title="Important notice" type="info">
  At this time we only support [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the main bundler
  (even if other bundlers might be used without any issue), and all dashboard
  apps require pnpm as package manager. Also, both App Elements and all Commerce
  Layer dashboard apps use [wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) as react
  routing.

## Local development

When you work with App Elements you can preview components directly in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). You just need to launch e development server:

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  code={`
pnpm install
pnpm dev
`}
/>

You can link this package in other applications using pnpm:

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  code={`
pnpm build:elements --watch

cd ~/projects/app-elements/packages/app-elements
pnpm link --global

cd ~/projects/my-app/packages/app
pnpm link --global @commercelayer/app-elements
`} />
